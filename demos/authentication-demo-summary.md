# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## What Was Changed

### Before (Hardcoded Credentials):
```bash
# Old way - credentials hardcoded in every demo
curl -u admin:password "$BASE_URL/halo/player/985752863/stats"
```

### After (Dynamic Authentication):
```bash
# New way - credentials from user login
curl -u "$DEMO_USERNAME:$DEMO_PASSWORD" "$BASE_URL/halo/player/$DEMO_PLAYER_ID/stats"
```

## New Login System Features

1. **Interactive Login Prompt**
   - Users enter their own username and password
   - Password input is hidden for security
   - Authentication is tested against real backend

2. **Environment Variables Set**
   - `DEMO_USERNAME` - The authenticated username
   - `DEMO_PASSWORD` - The user's password
   - `DEMO_CREDENTIALS` - Combined "username:password"
   - `DEMO_PLAYER_ID` - The player's ID from their profile
   - `DEMO_GAMERTAG` - The player's gamertag

3. **Personalized Experience**
   - Welcome message shows user's gamertag
   - Demos use the logged-in user's data
   - No more hardcoded "admin" credentials

## How It Works

1. Run `./run-all-demos.sh`
2. System prompts for username and password
3. Credentials are validated against backend
4. On success, environment variables are exported
5. All demos inherit these credentials
6. Each demo uses `$DEMO_USERNAME:$DEMO_PASSWORD` for API calls

## Benefits

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in demos
- ✅ Secure password entry
- ✅ Real authentication validation
- ✅ Personalized demo experience
- ✅ Environment variable propagation
- ✅ Works with any valid user account

## Available Users

The system shows available demo users:
- admin (full access)
- player (standard access)
- user (basic access)
- guest (limited access)

Each user can login with their own credentials and experience the demos with their own data and permissions!
